### MacOSX
**Note:** it is a good idea to install the **Java SE Development Kit** before you will be able to run the software. You can find it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 
Trust the downloaded .dmg file, Oracle is sufficiently trustworthy!

To run the software for the first time execute the following steps:

  1. In a Mac open the folder that contains the software
  2. Hold the **Ctrl** button, click the file **uTerms.jar** and from the menu that opens select **Open**. The first time you run the software, Mac OS gives you a message that *this is an untrusted application*. 
  Ignore the message and click **Open**. 
  3. It will ask you for your username and password that you use to install applications. Enter both and hit Ok.
  4. From this moment you will be able to run your application by double clicking, or Ctrl+click and Open.
