# Introduction

Welcome to the project page for **uTerms**: a _software to highlight potentially **u**nfair **Terms** of Service_. You can download it [here](#Downloads).

The idea behind **uTerms** is to assist consumer law organisations in ensuring that **terms of online services** are **fair**. We are all bound by these agreements ("I have read and accept..."), though we cannot influence their content. For such situations, European Union has put [unfair contract terms legislation](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_rights/rights-contracts/unfair-contract/index_en.htm) in place. In theory, consumer law enforcers have competence to challange businesses who use unbalanced contracts. In practice, there are so many platforms our there, and their contracts so long and so intransparent, that consumer law organisations simply have not enough resources to check **all** of them. Hence, the idea to **automate** at least some tasks in their work. That's why we created **uTerms**.

# Functionalities of uTerms <a id="functions"></a>

Here I will insert the functionalities


# Downloads <a id="Downloads"></a>
  * Windows. Installation file ([.exe](https://github.com/ypanagis/uterms/releases/download/1.4.1/uTerms-1.4.1.exe))
  * MacOS. Zip file ([.zip](https://github.com/ypanagis/uterms/releases/download/1.4.1/uTerms.zip))
  
## Installation
### Windows
Download the `.exe` file from above. Run it and follow the steps. The software gets installed at: `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\uTerms`.
### MacOSX
  1. Download the zip file from above
  2. Unzip it in a folder in your home directory
  
## Running the software
### Windows
On **Windows 10** your software will be under **Apps > uTerms.software > uTerms**, or you can press `Windows key + S` and type "uTerms" and Enter.

### MacOSX
**Note:** it is a good idea to install the **Java SE Development Kit** before you will be able to run the software. You can find it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 
Trust the downloaded .dmg file, Oracle is sufficiently trustworthy!

To run the software for the first time execute the following steps:

  1. In a Mac open the folder that contains the software
  2. Hold the **Ctrl** button, click the file **uTerms.jar** and from the menu that opens select **Open**. The first time you run the software, Mac OS gives you a message that *this is an untrusted application*. 
  Ignore the message and click **Open**. 
  3. It will ask you for your username and password that you use to install applications. Enter both and hit Ok.
  4. From this moment you will be able to run your application by double clicking, or Ctrl+click and Open.
