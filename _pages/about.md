## Introduction
The idea behind **uTerms** is to assist consumer law organizations in ensuring that **terms of online services** are **fair**. We are all bound by these agreements *("I have read and accept...")*, though we cannot influence their content. For such situations, European Union has put [unfair contract terms legislation](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_rights/rights-contracts/unfair-contract/index_en.htm) in place. In theory, consumer law enforcers have competence to challenge businesses who use unbalanced contracts. In practice, there are so many platforms out there, and their contracts so long and so nontransparent, that consumer law organizations simply have not enough resources to check **all** of them. Hence, the idea to **automate** at least some tasks in their work. That's why we created **uTerms**.
